## INTERMAGNET Data Portal Moving

The host for the INTERMAGNET data portal is moving from Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) to the 
British Geological Survey (BGS). A number of services provided by NRCan, including web site 
download and ftp access to INTERMAGNET provisional and real-time data, will stop at the end of 
November 2022. Replacement services are already available from BGS. Not all the data 
that is available from NRCan’s implementation of the data portal is currently available at the 
BGS data portal, but work is hand to complete the transfer of all data by the end of November 
2022. The way you access data via the new services at BGS differs from how you have accessed 
data in the past using the services provided by NRCan. We encourage you to try the new services 
available at BGS before the services at NRCan close down. The following facilities are available:

- A data visualisation and download web site: 
  [https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/GINForms2](https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/GINForms2)
- A description of the INTERMAGNET data access web service: 
  [https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/](https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/)
- An ftp service: imag-ftp.bgs.ac.uk
  
We encourage you to use the web service in preference to the ftp service. It will become 
increasingly difficult to access ftp servers in the future – support for ftp in web browsers 
has already been largely withdrawn. INTERMAGNET is likely to withdraw the ftp service in the future.
