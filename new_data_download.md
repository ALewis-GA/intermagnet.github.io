## INTERMAGNET Data Portal

The INTERMAGNET data portal is hosted at the British Geological Survey (BGS). The service at BGS includes all INTERMAGNET provisonal and definitive data.

The data portal offers a number of ways to access Intermagnet data:

- A data visualisation and download web site: 
  [https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/GINForms2](https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/GINForms2)
- A description of the INTERMAGNET data access web service: 
  [https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/](https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/)
- A HAPI web service interface to INTERMAGNET data:
  [https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/hapi](https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/hapi).
  For information about HAPI see [https://hapi-server.org/](https://hapi-server.org/).
- An ftp service: imag-ftp.bgs.ac.uk
  
We encourage you to use the web services in preference to the ftp service. It will become increasingly difficult to access ftp servers in the future â€“ support for ftp in web browsers has already been largely withdrawn. INTERMAGNET is likely to withdraw the ftp service in the future.
