## What data should I send to INTERMAGNET?

To join INTERMAGNET you need to be able to send provisional real-time minute
mean data to one of the Geomagnetic Information Nodes within 72 hours of
recording. You also need to be able to send definitive data within the deadline
set in INTERMAGNET’s annual call for data. If you are able, INTERMAGNET would
very much welcome some other data products:

- If you are able to send your data more frequently, this would be very welcome – see the question How do I send my observatory data to INTERMAGNET in near
real-time?

- If you are able to send 1-second data (in IAGA-2002 format -
https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vdat/IAGA2002/iaga2002format.html) INTERMAGNET
would welcome this as well. If you do start sending 1-second data, you will need
to keep sending minute mean data. INTERMAGNET will not derive minute mean data
from 1-second data.

- If you are able to send quasi definitive data, this would
be particularly welcome at the present time in support of satellite measurements
of the geomagnetic field. See the question What is quasi-definitive data?


## How do I get a real-time data feed from INTERMAGNET?

INTERMAGNET data is available via FTP. Automated processes can interrogate the
INTERMANGET FTP site frequently to discover whether new data is available and to
download it if it is. This offers users the ability to retrieve data from
INTERMAGNET in real-time. You will need a username and password to gain access
to the FTP site – to request this access contact
