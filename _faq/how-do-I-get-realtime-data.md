INTERMAGNET data is available via FTP. Automated processes can interrogate the
INTERMANGET FTP site frequently to discover whether new data is available and to
download it if it is. This offers users the ability to retrieve data from
INTERMAGNET in real-time. You will need a username and password to gain access
to the FTP site â€“ to request this access contact
