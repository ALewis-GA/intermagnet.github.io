title: What data should I send to INTERMAGNET?
layout: faq

To join INTERMAGNET you need to be able to send provisional real-time minute mean data to one of the Geomagnetic Information Nodes within 72 hours of recording. You also need to be able to send definitive data within the deadline set in INTERMAGNET’s annual call for data. If you are able, INTERMAGNET would very much welcome some other data products:

- If you are able to send your data more frequently, this would be very welcome – see the question [How do I send my observatory data to INTERMAGNET in near real-time](6.how-do-i-send-data.html)?
- If you are able to send 1-second data (in [IAGA-2002 format](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vdat/IAGA2002/iaga2002format.html)) INTERMAGNET would welcome this as well. If you do start sending 1-second data, you will need to keep sending minute mean data. INTERMAGNET will not derive minute mean data from 1-second data.
- If you are able to send quasi definitive data, this would be particularly welcome at the present time in support of satellite measurements of the geomagnetic field. See the question [What is quasi-definitive data](4.what-is-quasi.html)?
