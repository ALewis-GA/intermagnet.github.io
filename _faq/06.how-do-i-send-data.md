The best way to do this is to use the [IAGA-2002 data format](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vdat/IAGA2002/iaga2002format.html){:target="_blank"} which allows small fragments of a day file to be transmitted to the INTERMAGNET web service. Using this approach, some observatories are sending data as frequently as once every five minutes, allowing it to be available for distribution from the INTERMAGNET web site within twenty minutes of recording.
