title: INTERMAGNET Data
---

**DRAFT - This is a draft website page - DRAFT**

INTERMAGNET data are available as digital data files, via the INTERMAGNET web site [www.intermagnet.org](www.intermagnet.org), or via INTERMAGNET's ftp server [ftp.seismo.nrcan.gc.ca](ftp://ftp.seismo.nrcan.gc.ca). The availability of preliminary data files is dependant on the publishing delay of participating institutes. Pre-INTERMAGNET data may be available via one of the World Data Centres for Geomagnetism (WDC) or the observatory contact of the specific Magnetic Observatories, which can be found [here](http://www.intermagnet.org/imos/imotblobs-eng.php).

Plots can be generated for all INTERMAGNET data available through this web site.

## Conditions of Use

The member institutes of INTERMAGNET invest considerable resources to operate their magnetic observatories to INTERMAGNET standards. It is important that the institutes producing the data have a measure of the scientific return on their investment.

The data made available through INTERMAGNET are provided for your use and are not for commercial use or sale or bulk distribution to third parties without the written permission of the institute operating the observatory. Publications making use of the data should include an acknowledgment statement of the form given below. A citation reference should be sent to the INTERMAGNET Secretary for inclusion in a publications list on the INTERMAGNET website. The secretary's address can be found at [Organizational Structure](http://www.intermagnet.org/structops-eng.php).

## Acknowledgement of data from observatories participating in INTERMAGNET

We offer two acknowledgement templates. The first is for cases where data from many observatories have been used and it is not practical to list them all, or each of their operating institutes. The second is for cases where research results have been produced using a smaller set of observatories.

### Suggested Acknowledgement Text (template 1)

The results presented in this paper rely on data collected at magnetic observatories. We thank the national institutes that support them and INTERMAGNET for promoting high standards of magnetic observatory practice (www.intermagnet.org).

### Suggested Acknowledgement Text (template 2)

The results presented in this paper rely on the data collected at observatory name. We thank institute name, for supporting its operation and INTERMAGNET for promoting high standards of magnetic observatory practice (www.intermagnet.org).
